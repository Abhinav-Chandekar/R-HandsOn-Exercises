#AMMA Hands on exercises

#Exercise 1 - Problem 2
install.packages("datasets.load")
women #To see the existing elements of women dataset
class(women) #To check if women is a data.frame

mean.height<-mean(women$height) 
mean.weight<- mean(women$weight)
#To calculate mean height and weight and store in a variables

mean.height
mean.weight

#Method 1 - Logic Condition of row

df1<- women[women$height>mean.height&women$weight<mean.weight,]
#Applies condition on rows of women and creates a data frame df1 with rows that satify the condition

df1
View(df1) #To view the elements that satisfy the condition
#In this case 0 rows satisfy the above condition of height>mean.height&weight<mean.weight

#Method 2 - Using Subset Function 

df2 <- subset(women,height>mean.height&weight<mean.weight)
#Uses function 'subset' to apply condition 
df2
View(df2)
class(df2)

#Method 3 - Using a for loop to apply condition to get the number directly (no data frame)
x=0
for(q in 1:15)
{
  if(women[q,1]>mean.height&women[q,2]<mean.weight)
  {
    x=x+1
  }
  else(0)
}
print(x)
#x is the number of cases for which the condition holds true - 0 in this case
